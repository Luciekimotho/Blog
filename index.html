    <h3> Moringa school.</h3>
    <p> Have started my 16 weeks of intensive programming at Moringa today and it feels great. The programming looks engaging and the instructors are great so far. We have started with HTML and CSS  and I hope to learn a lot by the time we are done with this. And by a lot I mean a website that is as functional as it is attractive and pleasing. No more templates!</p>
